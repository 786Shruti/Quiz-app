# Quiz App with Gamification

This is a **web-based quiz application** built using **React.js**, featuring gamification elements such as score tracking, answer reviews, and badges based on performance. The quiz data is fetched from an external API, and the app displays multiple-choice questions with interactive feedback. After completing the quiz, the user is shown a score summary, including correct/incorrect answers and a gamified award system.
